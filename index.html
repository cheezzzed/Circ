			Do I work in src or dist? Good question.

			First of all, if you're a newbie and you don't want to worry about any of this
			Prepros or Gulp stuff, or scss, or browser-syncing, just do everything in dist.
			In fact, just delete the src folder.

			If you're a geek and want to get into it, here's some background...

			Prepros and Gulp do mostly the same things. Prepros is a GUI (it's pretty),
			Gulp is a CLI (it's in the terminal, and it's ugly).

			Both will watch your files, and where appropriate, they will error-check and
			compile them from one format to another. To stay organized, we have to
			split things up between the files we write: the *source* files in "src";
			and the files they become: the files that get *distributed* on the web, in "dist".

			So src/scss files become dist/css files,
			And src/js files become dist/js files (that have been compiled down to ES5),
			And src/img files become dist/img files (that have been compressed for you).

			Anything that doesn't need compiling/compressing/error-checking (plugins, video, fonts, etc),
			just put straight in *dist*.

			One way to remember it is: you're only going to distribute *dist*. You keep the source files
			to yourself, hidden from the world.

			Go here to learn more about src and dist:

			Or here for detailed instructions on setting up the gulp command line helper.
